        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Your privacy matters. PenPal is designed with privacy at its core.</p>

        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Weight measurements you enter or import from Apple Health</li>
            <li>Injection records including date, dose, and site location</li>
            <li>Profile information: height, target weight, biological sex</li>
            <li>Medication preferences and schedules</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p>All your data is stored locally on your device using Apple's Core Data framework. If you enable iCloud sync, your data is also stored in your personal iCloud account using Apple's CloudKit service.</p>
        <p class="emphasis">We do not have access to your data. Your health information never leaves your device or your personal iCloud account.</p>

        <h2>Apple Health Integration</h2>
        <p>If you grant permission, PenPal can read your height and weight data from Apple Health, and write weight entries back to Apple Health. This data transfer happens entirely on your device — we cannot see or access your HealthKit data.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>PenPal does not share your data with any third parties. We do not use analytics services, advertising networks, or any external data processors.</p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete all your data at any time from the Profile tab. When you delete data with iCloud sync enabled, it will also be removed from iCloud.</p>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>PenPal retains your data for as long as you keep the app installed. There is no automatic expiration or deletion of your health records. Your injection history, weight entries, and profile information remain on your device (and in your iCloud account if sync is enabled) until you choose to delete them.</p>
        <p>If you delete the app, locally stored data is removed with it. iCloud data may persist in your iCloud account until you manually delete it or disable iCloud sync before uninstalling.</p>

        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>For questions about this privacy policy, contact us at privacy@penpal-app.com</p>
